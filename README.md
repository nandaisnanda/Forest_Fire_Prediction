## 🌟 Introduction
Forest fires 🔥 pose a significant threat to Algeria’s northern forests 🌳. By using meteorological and fire data, we aim to predict the occurrence of forest fires and understand the conditions that contribute to these events. This will help in creating effective prevention strategies and ensuring the safety of natural resources and nearby communities.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle: [Algerian Forest Fires Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitinchoudhary012/algerian-forest-fires-dataset). It contains data from **2012 to 2017** and includes meteorological measurements and fire occurrence records.

### Key features of the dataset:
- **Temperature** (°C): Daily average temperature 🌡️
- **Relative Humidity** (%): Daily humidity 💧
- **Wind Speed** (km/h): Speed of the wind 🌬️
- **Rainfall** (mm): Precipitation levels 🌧️
- **Fire Occurrence**: Whether a fire occurred (Yes/No) 🔥❌

The dataset is divided into two regions:
- **Bejaia Region** (Region 1)
- **Sidi Bel-Abbes Region** (Region 2)

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary goals of this project are:
- To analyze the meteorological factors that contribute to forest fires in Algeria.
- To build machine learning models that can predict the occurrence of fires based on these conditions.
- To provide insights that can help in forest fire management and prevention.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
We will use the following tools and libraries in this project:
- **Python** 🐍: The main programming language.
- **Pandas** 🐼: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** 🔢: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📊: For visualizing trends and data distributions.
- **Scikit-learn** 🧠: For building machine learning models.
- **XGBoost** 🚀: For gradient boosting to improve model accuracy.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for modeling, we need to:
1. Handle missing values or incorrect data entries 🛠️.
2. Convert categorical values (Yes/No for fire occurrence) to numerical ones (0/1) 🔄.
3. Normalize or scale numerical features to improve model performance 📏.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80% train, 20% test) 📊.

## 🧠 Modeling
We will apply the following machine learning models:
- **Logistic Regression** 📈
- **Random Forest** 🌳
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** ⚔️
- **XGBoost** 🚀

These models will be trained on meteorological data to predict whether a fire occurs. We will compare their performance based on accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## 📊 Evaluation
The models will be evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy** ✔️
- **Precision** 🎯
- **Recall** 📞
- **F1-Score** 🏅
- **ROC-AUC Curve** 📈

This will help us determine which model performs the best in predicting forest fires in Algeria.

## 🏁 Conclusion
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for forest fires in Algeria 🇩🇿 using meteorological data. By understanding the conditions that lead to fires, we can better manage and prevent them in the future. 🔥🌲
