## 🌟 Introduction
Wildfires are a huge problem 🌪️🔥 in the United States, causing damage to forests 🌲, wildlife 🦌, and even homes 🏡. This project aims to analyze historical wildfire data and build models that predict future wildfires, helping prevent environmental damage! 🌍💪

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [US Wildfire Records (6th Edition)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/behroozsohrabi/us-wildfire-records-6th-edition). It contains over **2 million wildfire records** 📂, including:
- **Year**: The year the fire occurred 🗓️
- **Cause**: Description of the cause of the fire 🔍
- **Size**: The size of the fire in acres 🌐
- **Latitude** and **Longitude**: Coordinates of the fire 📍

That's a lot of fires! 😱🔥

## 🎯 Project Objective
Our goals are:
- 🔍 Analyze wildfire patterns from 1992 to 2020.
- 🧠 Build machine learning models to predict fire occurrences.
- 📊 Evaluate models and provide insights for better fire management. 🔥🧯

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
We used a variety of tools to get the job done! 🚀💻
- **Python** 🐍: Our coding language.
- **Pandas** 🐼: For data handling.
- **NumPy** 🔢: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📊: For beautiful visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn** 🧠: For machine learning models.
- **XGBoost** 🚀: For advanced gradient boosting.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
Before we jump into modeling, we need to clean the data 🧼🧹:
1. Handle missing values 🤕
2. Feature engineering 🛠️ (extracting useful data like fire months 🌸🍁)
3. Encode categorical variables 🎲
4. Split data into training and testing sets 🔀

## 🧠 Modeling
Let's build some models! 🏗️ Here are the ones we’ll test:
- **Logistic Regression** 📈
- **Random Forest** 🌳🌳
- **XGBoost** 🚀
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** ⚔️

We'll train these models and see which one predicts wildfires the best! 🏆🔥

## 📊 Evaluation
We'll evaluate the models using these metrics:
- **Accuracy** ✔️
- **Precision** 🎯
- **Recall** 📞
- **F1-Score** 🏅
- **ROC-AUC Curve** 📈

Let’s find the best fire-predicting machine! 🤖🔥

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project aims to provide a reliable model for predicting wildfires, which can help support fire prevention agencies 🧑‍🚒 and contribute to saving the environment 🌎. Let's fight wildfires together! 🔥🧯
